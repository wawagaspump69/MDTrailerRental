    <div>
        <h4>Browse Our Fleet</h4>
        <p>Start by exploring our Fleet Page to find the trailer that fits your needs. We offer a range of trailers to make sure you have the right equipment for the job.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Select Your Trailer and Rental Period</h4>
        <p>Choose the trailer, and rental duration that works best for you. We recommend booking in advance to secure your trailer, especially during busy periods.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Reserve Your Trailer</h4>
        <p>Use our quick online booking system or give us a call to lock in your reservation. A refundable deposit is required to hold your booking. We’ll also ask for your driver’s license and insurance information, or you can have it ready by uploading it through our safe and secure portal.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Pick Up and Hit the Road</H4>
        <p>On the day of your rental, come to our location to pick up your trailer. Our team will be there to help with hitching, ensure the trailer is safely secured, and answer any last-minute questions.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Return the Trailer</h4>
        <p>Bring the trailer back to our location by the agreed return time. We’ll inspect it to ensure it’s in good condition, process your deposit refund, and you’re all set!</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 style="color: #D00000;">Requirements</h2>

        <div>
            <h4>Valid Driver’s License</h4>

        <div>
            <h4>Damage and Liability</h4>
            <p>Renters are responsible for any damage to the trailer during the rental period. Any damages will be assessed upon return, and repair costs may be deducted from the security deposit or charged to the renter.

        <div>
            <h4>Late Returns and Fees</h4>

            <p>Our trailers are intended for lawful use only. The transport of hazardous materials, illegal items, or anything that may damage the trailer is strictly prohibited.
