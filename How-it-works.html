        <p>Start by exploring our Fleet Page to find the trailer that fits your needs. We offer a range of trailers to make sure you have the right equipment for the job.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Select Your Trailer and Rental Period</h4>
        <p>Choose the trailer, and rental duration that works best for you. We recommend booking in advance to secure your trailer, especially during busy periods.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Reserve Your Trailer</h4>
        <p>Use our quick online booking system or give us a call to lock in your reservation. A refundable deposit is required to hold your booking. We’ll also ask for your driver’s license and insurance information, or you can have it ready by uploading it through our safe and secure portal.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Pick Up and Hit the Road</H4>
        <p>On the day of your rental, come to our location to pick up your trailer. Our team will be there to help with hitching, ensure the trailer is safely secured, and answer any last-minute questions.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Return the Trailer</h4>
        <p>Bring the trailer back to our location by the agreed return time. We’ll inspect it to ensure it’s in good condition, process your deposit refund, and you’re all set!</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 style="color: #D00000;">Requirements</h2>

        <div>
            <h4>Valid Driver’s License</h4>
            <p>Renters must have a current, valid driver’s license. For larger trailers, please ensure you are comfortable with towing and have any necessary endorsements if required.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Proof of Insurance</h4>

<h2 style="color: #D00000;">Disclaimers and Policies</h2>

        <div>
            <h4>Damage and Liability</h4>
            <p>Renters are responsible for any damage to the trailer during the rental period. Any damages will be assessed upon return, and repair costs may be deducted from the security deposit or charged to the renter. MD Trailer Rentals is not liable for any accidents, injuries, or damages to personal property while the trailer is in your possession. Please follow all safety guidelines for towing and loading to ensure a safe experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Insurance Coverage</h4>
            <p>We strongly recommend that renters verify towing coverage with their personal insurance provider before renting. Rolling Rentals is not responsible for damages not covered by your insurance.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Late Returns and Fees</h4>
            <p>Trailers must be returned by the agreed time. Late returns may incur additional fees based on the rental rate. If you’re running late, please inform us to avoid extra charges. Trailers returned excessively late without notice may result in a penalty fee or loss of deposit.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Cleaning Policy</h4>
            <p>Please return the trailer in clean condition. Excessive dirt, debris, or other materials left in or on the trailer may result in a cleaning fee. This helps us ensure that each customer receives a well-maintained trailer.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Cancellation and Refund Policy</h4>
            <p>Cancellations made at least 24 hours in advance will receive a full refund. Cancellations within 24 hours of pick-up may incur a cancellation fee. Refunds for early returns are not provided unless prior arrangements have been made with our team.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Prohibited Uses</h4>
            <p>Our trailers are intended for lawful use only. The transport of hazardous materials, illegal items, or anything that may damage the trailer is strictly prohibited. Please avoid overloading trailers beyond their maximum weight capacity, as this can cause damage and poses a safety risk.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Interstate and Long-Distance Rentals</h4>
            <p>If you plan to take the trailer across state lines or for an extended trip, please inform us in advance.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Weather Policy</h4>
